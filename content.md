**Title**: Sophia Bartolacci

"“I’m a Computer Science student at Drexel University with a passion for creating innovative digital experiences. With a strong foundation in programming, data science, and UI/UX design, I enjoy working on projects that blend functionality with creativity. Here, you’ll find a collection of my work—ranging from web development to personal photography—that showcases my skills, creativity, and commitment to continuous learning."

"Take a look around, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or learn more!”

# About 
“Hello, I’m Sophia Bartolacci, a Computer Science major at Drexel University, pursuing minors in both Data Science and UI/UX Design. I’ve always been passionate about solving complex problems and building meaningful digital experiences, whether it's through clean, efficient code or thoughtfully designed interfaces. My academics have helped me build a wide range of skills in software development, data analysis, and user-centered design, that I love applying to real-world projects."

"Outside of school, photography has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. There’s something incredibly satisfying about getting the perfect shot, where everything aligns just right. Photography gives me a chance to slow down, appreciate the details, and see the world through a different lens. It provides a creative outlet for me to get away from the analytical aspects of college."

"I’m always looking for opportunities to learn, grow, and collaborate with others. Whether it’s through a new project or a challenging problem to solve, I’m eager to continue expanding my skills and making a positive impact.”

# Projects 
## Redesign of GIANT's App Using Figma 
**Summary**:
"I took on the challenge of redesigning GIANT's app using Figma to address the usability issues I noticed as a frequent user. The original app's navigation and overall design felt cluttered and unintuitive, so I set out to create a cleaner, more user-friendly interface."

"My redesign focused on streamlining navigation, enhancing the visual hierarchy, and improving the overall user experience. This project was my first experience with Figma, driven by a desire to learn the tool and apply my design skills to a real-world scenario.”

## Blueboard 
### **Overview**
In my web development class, I collaborated with a group of five over five weeks to create Blueboard, an interactive online learning platform designed for both students and professors.

Blueboard offers a variety of tools to enhance the learning experience, including quizzes, course materials, and more.

This project allowed us to work together to design and implement a user-friendly platform that supports both teaching and learning.

### **Features**

User Authentication: Professors and students can create accounts and log in securely.

Quiz Creation and Management: Professors can create quizzes with various question types, including multiple-choice, short answer, long answer, and image upload. Quizzes can be autograded or manually graded.

Course Management: Professors can create courses, generate registration codes, and manage course materials.

Student Interaction: Students can enroll in courses, participate in quizzes, and view grades.
File Upload and Download: Supports uploading images as part of quiz answers and downloading images from the server.

Session Management: Ensures secure access to various routes based on user roles (student or professor).

Deployment Ready: Configured for deployment on platforms like Fly.io.

### **Technology Stack**

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: Session-based using express-session

Deployment: Configured for Fly.io deployment
